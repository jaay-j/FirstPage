        <ol>
        <li>Limit your typefaces</li>
        <li>Don't be scared of scale</li>

    <h2>1. Limit your typefaces</h2>
    <img src="img/01.png">
        <p>When selecting a typeface or font for headings, subtitles and body text, use easy to read fonts for simple and effective graphic design. </p>
            <p class= "new-class">The eye finds it hard to scan multiple typefaces,</p> 
            <p>so stick to a simple collection of fonts. This design uses variants from the Aileron font family, a geometric sans serif typeface that has 
                <br>a simple and modern aesthetic.</p>
        <br>
    
    <h2>2. Don't be scared of scale</h2>
    <img src="img/02.png">
        <p> Apply scale to type, shapes or compositional features that need proportionate emphasis. Use appropriate colors to enhance this technique while 
            <br>making sure suitable typefaces that look good when increased in size. Here, Raleway for the word ‘Scale’ is strong and bold with clear forms.</p>
        <br>

    <h2>3. Respect the space of other elements</h2>
    <img src="img/03.png">
        <p>Use letter spacing to fill dead space, aligning text, or condense words that take up too much space. However, be careful not to reduce letter spacing so much it can’t be read, or increase it so much the letters become detached from one another. Here, the decreased letter spacing on the word ‘Respect’ gives a condensed effect, as a visual representation of space, or lack thereof.</p>
        <br>

    <h2>4. Use a small color scheme</h2>
    <img src="img/04.png">
        <p>Choose a color scheme that has 1-3 primary colors and an additional 1-3 secondary colors that contrast and complement each other. Use different tones of the same color for consistency by adjusting brightness for contrast. Finer typefaces will need stronger distinction against a colored background. Here, bright aqua is offset against forest green background for clarity and readability.</p>
        <br>

    <h2>5. Use Clean, crisp and clear imagery</h2>
    <img src="img/05.png">
        <p>Pump up contrast by adjusting the brightness of the background image so that it offsets the text color, making the design clear and easy to read. 
            <br>This is a great way to apply white or black text over an image to create a strong ‘cut-out’ effect.</p>
